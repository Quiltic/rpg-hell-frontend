# Basics

This game is built up around the idea of normal dice (d6's, or 6 sided dice). Any and all rolls that this game will ask you to do will be done using some amount of these dice, so go grab some. Personally I would recommend 4-6 per person, though you can play this with just 1 if need be.
This game is heavily inspired by YOU the players and your host known as the Game Master (denoted as GM from here on). The GM is the one hosting the show, and while this is the rule-book not all possible situations can be given clear ruling. Envitably it is up to the GM to decide what will happen. 

There are primarily 2 sections to this game, Out of Combat; which is where most roll-playing will take place and In Combat; which is where you fight monsters and other stuff.

For a complete and up to date rule set go to [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h8yUHFGRlDEHiQ5K4UsqGjIkeFcHh8aEjj2FuqFQs_c/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h8yUHFGRlDEHiQ5K4UsqGjIkeFcHh8aEjj2FuqFQs_c/edit?usp=sharing).





# Locking Dice

When you do a roll you may Lock a dice. This dice is set to the side and is removed from the roll. On later turns you may then replace a dice with your Locked dice. Replacing a dice removes the replaced dice from play and unlocks the Locked dice.
For example lets say I do a Physical Feats roll and roll five 6's. I probably don't need all five 6's for this roll so I can remove one of the 6's and have four 6's for this roll. Then lets say I roll to Hide and get two 1's. I can replace one of the 1's with my Locked 6, and now I have a 6 and a 1 in my current roll. 
**You can Not have more than 1 Locked dice at a time.**





# Magic

Magic is the ability to control souls to affect the world around them. Every creature, object, or place has a soul. Though typically only creatures are able to directly control souls.

As of now there are only 3 known ways to control soul: Strange grand movements which physically change the shape of souls, using Light to suppress or enhance souls, and through writing of Runes on items to bring out the items latent soul.

There are a number of ways to learn how to do magic. Some mages learn through intense study and hard work. Others learn how by tradition or special dances. Even more are born with such knowledge or even find them by shear coincidence.

Manipulation of souls is not without consequence. As such, when a creature or item cast or use magic, they gain a number of stacks of Soul Strain based on how strong the spell they are casting is (denoted next to the spell). Depending on how much they have trained their Soul (points in Soul) they may start to take damage from casting. A creature takes an amount of damage based on how much Soul Strain they have over their Max Soul Strain. Your max Soul Strain is 3 times your Soul. Though some Traits can increase this slightly. You loose all stacks of Soul Strain when you finish a Rest.




# Rest and Travel
## Rest

When you spend 8 or more hours doing non-extraneous effort, such as sleeping or relaxing, you gain the effects of a Rest. Rests do not need to be completed all at once, and can be broken up into multiple segments of at least 2 hour increments. However, you can only Rest up to twice a Day.

When you complete a Rest you gain the following bonuses:
- You fully heal, and regain all Armor effects such as Armor Health, Dodge, and Ward.
- You loose all non permanent Stack Effects, such as Wet or Soul Strain (these are just 2 examples. See Stack Effects for more).
- You regain all uses of spent Trait effects. (Some traits will say "You can do this a number of times per Rest")
- You loose all Stacks of Death's Door



## Travel

When moving long distances you move based on the average of all party member's Speed (rounded down). For example if a party has 3 people with speeds of 7,6,4 then the travel speed is 5.
Large grid is used when dealing with travel. A large tile is 2,160*2,160 tiles. Medium tiles are 36*36 tiles (can be used to move per minute). __If your using hex like a chad then its the same but in hex shape.__
Every Hour your party can move a number of Large tiles equal to your Party Travel Speed, mentioned above. 
Alternatively, your party can move 1 tile faster at the cost of being permanently Marked for the duration of travel. This condition lasts into combat if you get ambushed.
Or your party can move 1 tile slower to try to Hide during travel. You can roll Nature or Thieving for this check.
When using Boats, Riding Animals, Carts, Cars, or some similar vehicle you replace your speed with that of the vehicle.





# Out of Combat Rules

## Actions

These are actions that anyone can do. The basic listing of actions any creature can do is listed under their respective stat/skill down below.

Some actions require traits or items to acquire. An example is the Tunneler Trait which lets you easily break and move solid land, such as dirt or stone. Or the ever famous Cooking Tools which allow you to make foods you otherwise would have to buy to acquire.

Actions generally have 3 different ways of operating: Checks (the most common type), Contests, and Activatable (toggles or just works without rolling).



### Checks

When you want to do an Action that requires a check, you roll a number of dice based on the required stat or skill. The number of dice is equal to 2 with an additional dice for every point you put into the required check.
For example if you want to do a Physical Feat you roll a Body check, and you have a 3 in Body then you roll 5 dice (2 from default plus 3 from Body).

Depending on the check you will be able to do specific actions based on the values rolled. Some checks work where they list off a number of actions and for every dice group you give (typically 7 or more) you can redo that action a number of times. A good example is our Physical Feat roll, where you may give 7+ a number of times to increase the values of the roll.

Others will just have a total for the sum of all the dice rolled. A good example of this is our Cooking Tools, which give better foods the higher you roll.

You then tell your GM what you rolled and what action you want to try and the GM will tell you what happens next.



### Contests

Some Actions require Contests, which is a competition between two or more parties. When your GM asks you to roll a Contest you then roll a Check based on the required Stat or Skill similar to the ways checks work.
Whichever party has a higher sum wins the contest. If a tie happens it is based on the dice values rolled. If a tie where to come from this the players win.





# Combat

Combat is split up into Rounds, each Round a creature has 3 phases, Beginning which is where they take damage or effects from Stack Effects. Next their Action phase which is where they can do their Trait or Generic Actions. Lastly their end phase, which is where they loose stacks or effects.

## Initiative

All creatures in combat must roll Initiative to see when they may do their Actions in Combat. This value is calculated by rolling a dice then adding the characters Speed. Ties are decided based on the creatures base Speed (highest first).
Whichever creature has the highest speed goes first. Once all creatures have gone the Round is over and it goes back to being the first creatures turn.

## Action Dice (AD)

At the beginning of your turn you roll an amount of Action Dice (denoted as **AD** from here on) based on your __COMBAT DICE__ (Temp name). 
You can spend AD to do actions in Combat an amount denoted next to the Action as a #, one for each point.
Attacks and Contests count as ## (2 AD), Movement counts as # (1 AD), and Spells and Traits have varying amounts.



### AD Values Matter 

All weapons have special actions when you wield them. In order to be able to get this effect you must have the required Stat values, denoted next to the weapon. If you don't have these requirements you can still use the weapon but you only get the 4 or less effects regardless of dice values given.
On Attacks you give ## (2 AD), taking the sum of these 2 dice gives special effects. Higher sums are better than lower sums. By default the high value is 9 and the low value is 4.

When you give AD for movement if you give it a 1 your Speed is reduced by 1, if you give it a 6 it is increased by 1.



## Damage and Armor

Your Health is how much you can take before you are put on Death's Door. When you take damage you first reduce your Armor Health then your Health.

Armor grants an additional special set of Health called **Armor Health**. Different armors provide a varying amount of Armor Health. Armor Health is reduced before you take normal Health loss. Unlike normal Health Armor health cannot be regained from Healing Items or Spells.



## Deaths Door

When you are on 0 or less life you are put on Death's Door. While on Death's Door your have a normal Speed of 2 and every time you take damage while on Death's Door you roll a dice. If you roll less than the Death's Door value you Die, otherwise you increase Death's Door by 1.
: For example if you are on Death's Door and roll a 3 you live another turn and are on Death's Door 2.
: Another example is if you are On Death's Door 5 and roll a 2 you Die.
Death's Door only goes away if you do a Rest.
