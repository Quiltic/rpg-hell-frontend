# Core Rules


## Before we begin.

This game primarily revolves around the use of a d12 (12 sided dice) and many d6's (6 sided dice).

### Things You Will Want Before Playing

- A 12 sided dice (d12).
- At least one 6 sided dice (d6), though you may want many more.
- A 4 sided dice (d4).
- A way to keep notes, and edit your character.
- Friends. Or at least people willing to listen to your silly voices.



## Locked Dice

This is a very important aspect of ___. During any roll, check, contest, combat, or otherwise, you may Lock or Unlock a dice. When you Lock a dice you Lock a dice you remove the Locked dice from the roll and put it off to the side. On later rolls you may Unlock the dice to add it to the current roll. You can have up to 1 Locked dice at a time, can only Lock and Unlock once per roll, and lose your Locked Dice at the end of a Session. If you Lock a d12 it is Locked as a 1 instead of its original value.



## Checks

Sometimes you GM (Game Master) may ask you to do a Check using a specific Stat. When they do you roll a d12 then add your Stat to the rolled value. If you think you can use one of your Skills for the check you may ask your GM and if they agree you also add a d4 to the sum. After you roll you then tell your GM the total sum and they will inform you what happens next.

For example if you want to push a boulder, you may roll Body. Let's say you roll a 6, and have a 3 in Body, you would get 6+3 = 9 for the roll. This could mean that when pushing the boulder you push it down a hill, but you can't control where it goes, or if its a relatively small bolder it may even go exactly where you aimed it.
If you are in Combat you may give two dice of set values instead of giving ## (2 dice) and rolling. If you do, you do not add the requested Stat. For example if you give (5,5) in Combat you have a 10 for the check.



## Contests

Some situations require you to roll a Contest against another creature or target. When you do you roll the same as if it was a Check. Whichever party got the higher score wins the Contest. On a draw, the defender (once who is forced to roll) wins.
This works the same way in Combat.



## Advantage or Disadvantage

Some times you will have Advantage or Disadvantage on a Check or Contest. If you have Advantage, then you roll two d12's and chose whichever dice value. If you have Disadvantage you also roll 2d12 and then must pick the lower dice value. You still add any other bonuses to the roll regardless of dice value.


## Default Actions

These are actions every character can do regardless of statline.

### ***Help*** - When an ally is asked to do a check or contest you may add your Stat bonus to the requested Stat Bonus.
^Such poor wording.
