# Basic Rules

### Important Notes

This game uses weird dice, such as d4 (4 sided dice), d6 (normal 6 sided dice), and d12’s (12 sided dice). You will need these in order to play. The recommended number of dice is two d4, somewhere between six and nine d6, and two d12’s.

**As of writing this game is under development. Things will change so keep an eye on the docs.**

## Golden Rules

- ROUND UP. Everything that divides is rounded up.  
- Play Responsibly. This game is a group game, set up boundaries with your GM and other players, and try not to do things that would make other people uncomfortable.  
- Be Creative\! This game is designed for you to be able to express yourself and your creativity through your characters, so do just that.

## Checks

You may do a Check when trying to do an action. When you do roll 1d12 \+ required Stat. Some effects will give you bonuses to this roll, such as from a Story, when this happens gain the bonus to the roll. Give the summed value to your GM.

For GM’s; here are some example levels for difficulty of checks.

| Easy | Average | Difficult | Very Difficult | Nearly Impossible |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 5 | 9 | 12 | 14 | 17 |

## Contests

Some situations require you to roll a Contest against another creature or target. When you do you roll two dice then add the requested Stat. Whichever party got the higher score wins the Contest. On a draw, the defender (once who is forced to roll) wins.  
If you are in combat you may give two dice of set values instead of giving \#\# (2 dice) and rolling. If you do, you do not add the requested Stat. For example if you give (5,5) in combat you have a 10 for the contest.



## Activating Arts
Next to the names of Arts there are the tags Gesture, Vocal, and Spell. Arts may have more than one tag requiring you to follow through on all of them.
- If an Art has the tag Gesture, you must make a noticeable gesture or movement. Some movements may be taking a specific stance, such as Bull Rush.
- If an Art has the tag Vocal, you must make a sound or speak a phrase. Such as the Art Quip requiring you to do a quip. (This is just an example)
- If an Art has the tag Light, you must have an open hand or an item with Glow in order to activate it. The open hand or items will illuminate when activating the Art.



## Perception or Senses Checks

As you may have seen there is no stat, skill, or otherwise which covers the large blanket of perception or using ones senses. This is by design, as there are so many ways to use ones senses that in any particular instance your players could easily use one of the core or sub stats instead. For instance when talking to a NPC (non-player character) they may find themselves needing to roll Charm in order to "sense" a lie. 
Another example may be the party walking through the woods and needing to see if they are being stalked by some creature. In this case they should use Nature instead.
Here are a simplified listing of when it would be best to use a specific stat when asking for a "perception or sense" check.
- Body: Getting a general feel of an area.
- Mind: Investigation or looking at a more specific item or region.
- Soul: Looking for Magical or Spiritual effects.
- Arcana: When looking at a magical item or through some form of code.
- Charm: Best used in conversations.
- Crafting: When observing on a machine, mechanism, or blueprint.
- Medicine: Inspecting wounds, strange liquids, or medical equipment.
- Nature: When handling natural creatures or to find something in the wild.
- Thieving: When looking for something of value or to find something hidden.



# Optional Rules

*These rules are entirely optional and may be chosen or banned by the players/gm.*


### I know a Guy

When entering a new region each player may declare a character they have interacted with here in the past. They then describe their relation to the character, then roll a d6. On a 1;  the player owes the character a favor. On a 6; The character owes the player a favor. The player then describes how their last encounter ended.


### Deep Learning

When making a new character, at level 1, a player may reduce a Sub-Stat by 1 in order to give a different Sub-Stat \+1 (to a maximum of 2). They may only do this once, and only at level 1\.


### Lasting Injuries

When a player gains their first stack of Death’s Door per Rest they roll 1d6 gaining the below lasting injury. This injury does not go away on a Rest (except Temporarily Crippled) and can only be treated by some level 7 or higher Arts or specialists.

- 6: **Nothing**  
- 5: **Minor Disfigurement** \- You gain scars or lose a small part of you such as a tooth or patch of hair.  
- 4: **Temporarily Crippled** \- You have \-1d4 on the highest value dice in a roll. This effect goes away at the end of a Rest.  
- 3: **Lasting Fears** \- You become forever terrified of the source that put you on Death’s Door. You gain -1 on all rolls while the source or a similar source is nearby.  
- 2: **Major Disfigurement** \- You gain massive scars or lose a medium part of you such as a finger. You have \-1 to Charm and cannot easily cover up the damage.  
- 1: **Missing Part** \- You lose a hand, foot, eye, ear, etc. Until the part is replaced or healed you have \-1 on Senses rolls (eyes/ears/etc), cannot use two handed items (hand), or \-1 Speed (foot).
