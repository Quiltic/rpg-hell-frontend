# Basic Rules

### Important Notes

This game uses weird dice, such as d4 (4 sided dice), d6 (normal 6 sided dice), and d12’s (12 sided dice). You will need these in order to play. The recommended number of dice is two d4, somewhere between six and nine d6, and two d12’s.

**As of writing this game is under development. Things will change so keep an eye on the docs.**

## Golden Rules

- ROUND UP. Everything that divides is rounded up.  
- Play Responsibly. This game is a group game, set up boundaries with your GM and other players, and try not to do things that would make other people uncomfortable.  
- Be Creative\! This game is designed for you to be able to express yourself and your creativity through your characters, so do just that.

## Checks

You may do a Check when trying to do an action. When you do roll 1d12 \+ required Stat. Some effects will give you bonuses to this roll, such as from a Story, when this happens gain the bonus to the roll. Give the summed value to your GM.

For GM’s; here are some example levels for difficulty of checks.

| Easy | Average | Difficult | Very Difficult | Nearly Impossible |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 5 | 9 | 12 | 14 | 17 |

## Contests

Some situations require you to roll a Contest against another creature or target. When you do you roll two dice then add the requested Stat. Whichever party got the higher score wins the Contest. On a draw, the defender (once who is forced to roll) wins.  
If you are in combat you may give two dice of set values instead of giving \#\# (2 dice) and rolling. If you do, you do not add the requested Stat. For example if you give (5,5) in combat you have a 10 for the contest.



# Combat Rules

Combat is split up into Rounds, each Round lasts 10 seconds and has 3 phases; Beginning which is where they take damage or effects from then roll their COMBAT DICE. Their Action phase which is where they can spend COMBAT DICE to do actions. Lastly their end phase, which is where they lose effects.


## Initiative

All creatures in combat must roll Initiative to see when they may do their Actions in Combat. This value is calculated by 1d12+SPEED. Ties are decided based on the creature's base Speed (highest first). Players always win if speeds are the same. Whichever creature has the highest Initiative goes first. Once all creatures have gone the Round is over and it goes back to being the first creature's turn.

*The world and vehicles (earthquakes, neutral NPC's, carts, and other creature related actions) always go last in Initiative.*


## Action Dice (AD)

At the beginning of your turn you roll an amount of dice based on your COMBAT DICE (Temp name). COMBAT DICE can be calculated as 3+(LEVEL/2). You can spend these dice to do actions in Combat. Every action asks for a different amount of dice, denoted next to the Action as a number of \#. Depending on the action taken the values for the dice may or may not matter. For example, when you take/use the Art ‘Summon Zombie’ it requires you to give it \#\#\#, or three dice. This dice value does not matter as you will always do its effect. On the other hand the Art ‘Flex’ asks for \#, one dice, but requires a 5 or 6 to do its effect.

Attacks and Contests are always \#\# (2 dice), Movement and buffs are usually \# (1 dice), and other Arts could have varying amounts, which are listed within them.


## Attack Dice Values Matter

All weapons have special actions when you wield them. In order to be able to get this effect you must have the required Stat values, denoted next to the weapon. If you don't have these requirements you can still use the weapon but you always gain the Weapon Downside.

On Attacks when you give \#\# (2 dice) you take the sum of these dice, sometimes giving special effects. Higher sums are better than lower sums. By default the high value is 9 and the low value is 4\. : For example a sword (short or long) does 1 extra damage on a 9 or higher, and 1 less damage on a 4 or lower.


## Damage and Armor

*Your Health is how much you can take before you are put on Death's Door, and is calculated by Health \= LEVEL \+ 4\*BODY \+ 3\*MIND \+ 2\*SOUL.*

Armors give special bonuses based on the type of armor. The most prevalent bonus is a special set of Health called Shielding. Different armors provide a varying amount of Shielding. Shielding is reduced before you take normal Health loss. Unlike normal Health, Shielding cannot be regained from healing or most Arts.

*Shielding does not reduce damage from, Falling, Drowning, or Strain damage.*

Some armors provide or remove Dodge. When you are Attacked, you roll 1d12+DODGE. If the value is higher than the Attack sum you do not get hit.

Lastly, few armors provide Ward. When you do a Dodge roll you may reduce the number of Ward you have by 1 to redo the Dodge roll. You cannot remove stacks with ward once you have gained them. You may only have a max of your LEVEL Ward at any given point in time.

All effects from Armor are regained at the end of a Rest.


## Death's Door

When you are put at 0 or less health you do not immediately die. Rather, you gain stacks of Death's Door. You gain 1 stack of Death's Door then set your health to your LEVEL.

While you have stacks of Death's Door you gain a specific ailment.

- **At Death's Door 1**, you are permanently Slowed.  
- **At Death's Door 2**, you become unconscious, and cannot be woken up until you lose Death's Door stacks or are healed for more than half your Max Health.  
- **At Death's Door 3**, You Die.

You lose all stacks of Death's Door at the end of a Rest.


## Common Actions

*These are actions every creature has access to.*

**Move** \- Spend \#; Move your SPEED. If you need to climb something, do a Body check.  
*Jumping: When you do a move you may do a standing jump up 1+(BODY/2) or long-jump 2+BODY horizontally.*

**Attack** \- Spend \#\#; Do a Weapon Attack within the weapons range. If a dice sum of 7 or less is given, gain the Attack Bonus. If a dice sum of 9 or higher is given, gain the Attack Downside.  
*Dual Welding: You may dual wield weapons if both weapons are Side Weapons. When you do, you may combine the On Hit, Bonus, and Downside of both weapons into one Attack.*

**Grapple** \- Spend \#\#; Do a Body Contest against a target within 1 tile of you. If you win, the target becomes Grappled by you.

**Push** \- Spend \#\#; Do a Body Contest against a target within 1 tile of you. If you win, the target is pushed back 1+BODY tiles away from you. (This counts as Knockback and can do Knockback damage.)

**Hide** \- Spend \#\#; Do a Thieving check, on a 9 or higher you are Hidden until you spend dice to do a non-Thieving action. (Movement does not break this.)

**Lock a Dice** \- Spend \#; Lock the dice spent. You may only ever have 1 Locked dice at a time. Locking a dice while having a Locked dice will replace the old dice with the new dice. You may later unlock that dice to spend on Arts or as a bonus dice in combat.  
	*You may only ever lock d6’s, and lose any unspent locked dice at the end of combat.*




# Mysc Rules

*This is a listing of various important rules that had no specific home.*


### Fall Damage

If you fall from more than 3 tiles up you take damage equal to how many tiles you have fallen. For example if you fell from 3 tiles you take no damage, but if you fall from 7 tiles up you would take 7 damage.



### Knockback Damage

If you are knocked back into non-destructible surface (wall) you take damage for every tile you do not move. For example; if you get knocked back 5 tiles and hit a wall after 2 tiles you take 3 damage.



### Hoard Rules

*This rule is designed for players who summon a large amount of the same creature (such as from Summon Zombie.) These rules are already in place for premade creatures for GM’s.*

A horde is 4 or more creatures of the same or similar type (zombies, dogs, monsters, etc). These creatures change from being individuals into 1 creature. Their Hp/Shielding is combined, they become a 2x2 (that can move through 1x1), they cannot be Grappled, Do two Attacks per Attack action (same sum), and when a target is hit by an Attack they must roll 1d4+(\# of creatures in hoard-4). The target then takes the effects of being hit that many times.

If the horde is hit by an Attack that would cover it in its entirety (aoe) they roll once for this and take twice the effect (if possible). If the horde loses half its health it breaks into 2 individual creatures.


### Overlapping Creatures

*This is for when multiple creatures are on the same tile. Some examples are when a large creature consumes another creature, when a swarm enters another creature's space, or when a living armor is worn by another creature.*   
	  
When creatures overlap the outermost creature takes all effects that would originate from other tiles (Attacks, Buffs, etc.). The outermost creature has \+1 on Grapple contests and Attack sums against the inner most creature.  



# Optional Rules

*These rules are entirely optional and may be chosen or banned by the players/gm.*


### I know a Guy

When entering a new region each player may declare a character they have interacted with here in the past. They then describe their relation to the character, then roll a d6. On a 1;  the player owes the character a favor. On a 6; The character owes the player a favor. The player then describes how their last encounter ended.


### Deep Learning

When making a new character, at level 1, a player may reduce a Sub-Stat by 1 in order to give a different Sub-Stat \+1 (to a maximum of 2). They may only do this once, and only at level 1\.


### Lasting Injuries

When a player gains their first stack of Death’s Door per Rest they roll 1d6 gaining the below lasting injury. This injury does not go away on a Rest (except Temporarily Crippled) and can only be treated by level 7 or higher Art’s or specialists.

- 6: **Nothing**  
- 5: **Minor Disfigurement** \- You gain scars or lose a small part of you such as a tooth or patch of hair.  
- 4: **Temporarily Crippled** \- You have \-1d4 on the highest value dice in a roll. This effect goes away at the end of a Rest.  
- 3: **Lasting Fears** \- You become forever terrified of the source that put you on Death’s Door. You gain Feared while the source or a similar source is nearby.  
- 2: **Major Disfigurement** \- You gain massive scars or lose a medium part of you such as a finger. You have \-1 to Charm and cannot easily cover up the damage.  
- 1: **Missing Part** \- You lose a hand, foot, eye, ear, etc. Until the part is replaced or healed you have \-1 on Senses rolls (eyes/ears/etc), cannot use two handed items (hand), or \-2 Speed (foot).
