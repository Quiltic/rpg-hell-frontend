## Perception or Senses Checks

As you may have seen there is no stat, skill, or otherwise which covers the large blanket of perception or using ones senses. This is by design, as there are so many ways to use ones senses that in any particular instance your players could easily use one of the core or sub stats instead. For instance when talking to a NPC (non-player character) they may find themselves needing to roll Charm in order to "sense" a lie. 
Another example may be the party walking through the woods and needing to see if they are being stalked by some creature. In this case they should use Nature instead.
Here are a simplified listing of when it would be best to use a specific stat when asking for a "perception or sense" check.
- Body: Getting a general feel of an area.
- Mind: Investigation or looking at a more specific item or region.
- Soul: Looking for Magical or Spiritual effects.
- Arcana: When looking at a magical item or through some form of code.
- Charm: Best used in conversations.
- Crafting: When observing on a machine, mechanism, or blueprint.
- Medicine: Inspecting wounds, strange liquids, or medical equipment.
- Nature: When handling natural creatures or to find something in the wild.
- Thieving: When looking for something of value or to find something hidden.

There are more times when to ask for more specific skills or even let your players decide. You may even want them to use any number of stats when doing a "perception" check.
