# Introduction
&ensp; Welcome to the RPG-hell rulebook! this page will serve as your starting point in this Tabletop Roleplaying Game. This game is still in active development so polish and fluff aren't the active priority; expect more words here in the future. I would recommend starting by reading the Core Rules.

## What's New?
&ensp; Well... You may notice that the entire rulebook isn't contained entirely on this page here. And there's a new set of buttons up there for navigating around. That's what's new! 😀
