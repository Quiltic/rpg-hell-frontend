# Miscellaneous Rules

*This is a listing of various important rules that had no specific home.*


### Horde Rules

*This rule is designed for players who summon a large amount of the same creature (such as from Summon Zombie.) These rules are already in place for premade creatures for GM’s.*

A horde is 4 or more creatures of the same or similar type (zombies, dogs, monsters, etc). These creatures change from being individuals into 1 creature. Their Hp/Shielding is combined, they become a 2x2 (that can move through 1x1), they cannot be Grappled, Do two Attacks per Attack action (same sum), and when a target is hit by an Attack they must roll 1d4+(\# of creatures in horde-4). The target then takes the effects of being hit that many times.

If the horde is hit by an Attack that would cover it in its entirety (aoe) they roll once for this and take twice the effect (if possible). If the horde loses half its health it breaks into 2 individual creatures.


### Overlapping Creatures

*This is for when multiple creatures are on the same tile. Some examples are when a large creature consumes another creature, when a swarm enters another creature's space, or when a living armor is worn by another creature.*   
	  
When creatures overlap the outermost creature takes all effects that would originate from other tiles (Attacks, Buffs, etc.). The outermost creature has \+1 on Grapple contests and Attack sums against the inner most creature.  


## Weapon Rules

- You CAN NOT get Attack Bonuses multiple times per Attack, such as if you give a 6 on an Attack Sum and spend Empowered. 
- If something was to give a Bonus to a weapon (such as an Enchantment) it becomes a part of the weapon’s Bonus.
- You may dual wield weapons if both weapons are Side weapons. When you do, you may combine the On Hit, Bonus, and Downside of both weapons into one Attack.
- After you do an Attack with a non-Side weapon you may spend # to do another Attack with +3 on the Attack Sum if you are using a Side Weapon.


## Armor

Shielding is only given at the end of a Rest. Swapping into armor that gives Shielding does not give Shielding on equip, and un-equipping armor that gives Shielding removes any Shielding granted.

## Crafting

When first wanting to craft an item you spend half the required cost. Then during a Rest, if you have the required tools (such as needing a forge for metal weapons), you make progress on creating the item. See the table below for approximate times. If you spend all day working on making the item then you may count this as 2 Rests. You may even gain a level of Exhaustion to count a Rest or day as being worth one more.

| Item | Time |
| :---- | :---- |
| Mundane (small items) | Can be done over a Break or instantly. |
| Mundane (weapons, armor) | 1 to 2 Rests |
| Common | 1 to 3 Rests |
| Uncommon | 1 to 2 Days |
| Rare | Months |
| Legendary | Months to Years |
