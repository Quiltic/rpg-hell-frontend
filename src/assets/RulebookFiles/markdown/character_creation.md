# Character Creation

## Level 1

Your Main-stats (Body, Mind, and Soul) all start at 0. Then you gain 2 Main-stat increases, you may place these increases however you wish in your Main-stats. For instance you may have a Main-stat line of 2,0,0 (Body, Mind, Soul); or a Main-stat line of 0,1,1. 

For your Sub-stats (Arcana, Charm, Crafting, Medicine, Nature, Thieving) you must use the following values: +2,+1,+1,0,-1,-1
You may place these values in any Sub-stat you chose. For example you may have a Nature focused character who doesn't care for talking to people. That character may have a Sub-stat line of 0,-1,-1,+1,+2,+1 (Arcana, Charm, Crafting, Medicine, Nature, Thieving).

## Stories
Make a short story or idea about your character. Each story you make gives you one of the below bonuses. These bonuses may stack or mingle from different stories. But each story must be unique.
- This story describes your history of interacting with certain groups of people (merchants, thieves, nobility, soldiers, etc). You may use any Stat instead of Charm when interacting with them.
- This story details your proficiency in a topic. When you roll a check that relates to this area you get an extra 1d4.
- This story paints you in a good light to a group or organization. This group is more welcoming to you and are more likely to offer aid (religion, organized crime, a town, etc.).
- This story gives you strange but special powers. Work with your GM to gain a simple non-combat ability that would relate to the story. (Examples; being tiny letting you move through small spaces, being a construct and letting you embed items into yourself, or being a traveler and having a bag of mundane travel items)

### Example Origin Stories

**Proficiency Ideas**
- Old Languages, Animals, Machines, Pick-Pocketing, Religion, Geography, Local Legends/Stories, Acrobatics, 

**Special Powers**
- **Nature Speaker** - I was born in the wilds, its animals are my family. I may have conversations with animals. This does not make the animal intelligent, it only lets you converse with them. I may use NATURE or CHARM when doing these conversations.
- **Mechanical Living** - I can change my parts. I can embed items within me at the end of a Rest. I can't embed more than my Level, but these items can't be dropped or forcefully taken from me.
- **Criminal** - I have spent most of my life doing crime. Why stop now? I learn the location of the Black Market or Underground, if one exists, upon entering a city for the first time.
- **Aquatic** - I can hold my breath for up to an hour.
- **Traveling Merchant** - My purse and I have traded all over. I have a business relationship with a merchant in every major city.



## Deep Learning
When making a new character, at level 1, a player may reduce a Sub-Stat by 1 in order to give a different Sub-Stat +1 (to a maximum of 2). They may only do this once, and only at level 1.
