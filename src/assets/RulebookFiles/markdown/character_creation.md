# Character Creation

## Level 1


Your Main-stats (Body, Mind, and Soul) all start at 0. Then you gain 2 Main-stat increases, you may place these increases however you wish in your Main-stats. For instance you may have a Main-stat line of 2,0,0 (Body, Mind, Soul); or a Main-stat line of 0,1,1. 

For your Sub-stats (Arcana, Charm, Crafting, Medicine, Nature, Thieving) you must use the following values: +2,+1,+1,0,-1,-1
You may place these values in any Sub-stat you chose. For example you may have a Nature Focused character who doesn't care for talking to people. That character may have a Sub-stat line of 0,-1,-1,+1,+2,+1 (Arcana, Charm, Crafting, Medicine, Nature, Thieving).

You gain 2 Skills of your choice (See Stats). 

*See Traits for the following section.*
Now for Traits you first must pick an Origin Trait.
You then gain 1 __OOC__, 1 __Combat__, and 1 Wildcard (__OOC__ or __Combat__) Trait that you meet the requirements for.

*See Items for the following section.*
For items you then may take 1 Weapon of your choice, a Side Weapon (must have the Side tag) or a Shield, any non-magical armor of your choice, and a Gadget or Potion of your Choice.
